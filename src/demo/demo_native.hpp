//  Nothing here touches the custom path; it only drives the engine's native
//  cl_demo_play and watches Com_Error.
//
//  Native demo facts established 2026-08-08 (see CLAUDE.md for the evidence):
//    - CL_Demo_Play_f is wrapped in `if (!com_sv_running)`. With a server up it
//      does NOTHING and prints NOTHING, so we check and report that ourselves.
//    - The engine appends ".demo" and prefixes "demo/", so we pass the stem.
//    - Header +0x04 is sizeof(header) == 79384 and must match this build.

	// CL_Demo_ReadDemoMessage (IDA 0x9188C0) is ALREADY hooked by the custom
	// theater (demo_playback.cpp, cl_demo_read_message_stub). A second
	// Hook::create on the same target returns MH_ERROR_ALREADY_CREATED, which

	// the duplicate detour is silently discarded and never runs. That cost a
	// whole test cycle on 2026-08-08; see CLAUDE.md RULE A3.
	//
	// So instead of hooking again, the theater's existing stub calls these two
	// on the native-playback path (theater not armed). Purely additive.

	// Returns true if the read was fully handled; *result is what to return.

	// ---- the gamestate repair ---------------------------------------------
	// ROOT CAUSE (proven offline over all five shipped demos, 2026-08-08):
	// packet 0 of every demo carries the svc_gamestate WITHOUT the 2-byte length
	// prefix that CL_ParseServerMessage unconditionally reads. The engine
	// therefore consumes the first two bytes of gamestate as a length, gets
	// 0xDAA9, MSG_ReadShort SIGN-EXTENDS it to -9559, and sub_DCAB0's
	// `if (8 * srcLen <= 0)` early-out returns SUCCESS with ZERO bytes decoded.
	// The gamestate vanishes with no error, connstate never leaves 5, every
	// snapshot is discarded, and the priming loop eats the whole file.
	//
	// Called from demo_recording.cpp's existing CL_ParseServerMessage hook
	// (RULE A3.1: that address is already hooked — never add a second one).
	// Returns true if the message was repaired. No-op unless a native demo is

	// frame by CL_SetCGameTime as serverTimeDelta + cls_realtime.
	//
	// Use this for ANYTHING THAT ANIMATES. demo_time() above is
	// cl.snap.serverTime, a step function that only moves when a snapshot is

	// ---- THEATER TRANSPORT ------------------------------------------------
	//
	// S2 ships a complete theater ENGINE and an incomplete front-end (PROVEN
	// 2026-08-10): the uiScript dispatcher implements PlayDemo / PreviewSegment
	// / MoveSegment / DeleteSegment / SwitchSegmentTransition, and every
	// PLATFORM_DEMO_DVR_* prompt is drawn by CG_OwnerDraw — but the timeline
	// materials (demo_timeline_solid / _faded / _arrow / _bookmark, demo_play)
	// have NO code references, and the LUI screen that would drive it all lives
	// in Lua inside the fastfiles.
	//
	// So rather than revive the menus, these call the engine's OWN action
	// handler, CL_Demo_HandleAction. Nothing here is a reimplementation; the
	// ids are the cases in that function's switch.
	// ---- CLIPS -------------------------------------------------------
	// The engine ships a complete segment/clip system with no front-end:
	//   cl_demo_savesegment 1   mark IN   (records the current time)
	//   cl_demo_savesegment 0   mark OUT  (appends the segment)
	//   cl_demo_previewsegment <n>        seek to segment n
	//   cl_demo_previewclip               play the marked clip
	//   cl_demo_deleteclip                clear every segment
	// All are gated on clc+262752 == 2, i.e. a demo is playing -- which is

	// (sub_915A10) returns the CURRENT keyframe index unless the current one is
	// newer than a fixed 800 ms cutoff or is registered in a 32-entry baseline
	// list — so "rewind" jumps to where you already are. We choose the keyframe
	// by time and drive the engine's own ProcessKeyFrameJump, which is a full

	//
	// Their whole fast-forward is `*cls.realtime += ticks`, and it needs NO
	// keyframes -- which is exactly the gap S2 had, since keyframes are written
	// as playback passes and so forward seeking could never pass where you had
	// already been.
	//
	// The same mechanism is present in S2 verbatim. CL_SetCGameTime derives
	// cl.serverTime = cls_realtime + cl.serverTimeDelta, then runs a feed loop
	// that reads demo packets until cl.serverTime catches cl.snap.serverTime. So
	// raising cls_realtime by N ms advances playback by N ms through the
	// engine's own pump.
	//
	// FORWARD ONLY, and the engine says why: cl.serverTime is clamped against
	// cl.oldFrameServerTime, so lowering cls_realtime does nothing. That is the

	// fast-forward is one line -- backward stays on S2's keyframes.

	// The stranded widgets come from a LUI model subscription that throws:
	//   ui/s2/mphud_uc.lua -> equippedperks_uc.lua -> divisions_utils.lua
	// dispatched by sub_36A550 via lua_pcall. `divisionsGlobalOverhaul` is a

	// roughly 36,890 of the 40,192 image slots, so only ~3,300 remain and a map
	// needs ~2,600-3,500 — loading one on top of the hub overflows the pool and
	// produces "Exceeded limit of 40192 'image' assets".
	//
	// MUST be called BEFORE the map load begins (that is what sub_48C0C0 does).
	// Releasing ui_mp after the loading screen has restarted LUI is a Lua
	// use-after-free — it crashed gibraltar once already.

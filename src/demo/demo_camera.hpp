//  DEMO CAMERA — framing controls for filming
// =====================================================================
//
// Everything here was recovered from the S2 IDB on 2026-08-31 (see
// CLAUDE.md). Three of the four need no code patching at all; the fourth
// repoints two single instructions using the same technique already
// proven for the free-camera speed.
//
//   FOV          ⛔ CORRECTED 2026-09-15. `cg_fov` is a real dvar, but it is
//                registered 50..100 and its domain callback (sub_3E750 ->
//                sub_45830) narrows the top further, so `cg_fov 120` or
//                `cg_fov 30` is silently REJECTED. A dvar slider could never
//                do cinematic framing.
//                The demo FOV is instead applied at sub_48460, the engine's
//                FINAL fov (in third/free camera it takes the cg_fov chooser
//                sub_45760 outright). One hook covers first, third and free
//                camera in BOTH demo systems. Live play is left alone.
//                Priority while a demo plays: dolly key > override > engine.
//
//   3rd person   CL_Demo_UpdatePlaybackView @0x9135D0 raises the camera by
//                +35.0 (instruction 0x9137C1) and CL_Demo_TraceViewForward
//                @0x913830 pulls it back 85.0 (instruction 0x913939).
//                BOTH constants are SHARED -- dword_B378E8 has 17 xrefs and
//                dword_B2D3A4 has 12 -- so the constants must NOT be
//                patched. We repoint the two INSTRUCTIONS instead, exactly
//                as the free-camera speed already does.
//
//   Roll         both camera movers write roll to cg+2355668 from usercmd
//                angle[2], which the mouse never produces. So the field is
//                plumbed and simply never fed: writing it after the mover
//                runs gives a dutch angle.
//
//   Screenshot   CL_Demo_CaptureScreenshot @0x916740 is the engine's own
//                TILED high-resolution capture (240x180 tiles at 1440). It
//                is action 17, which we block by default because it freezes
//                playback and moves the camera -- which is exactly what a
//                tiled capture does. Exposed here as a deliberate action
//                rather than a surprising key.

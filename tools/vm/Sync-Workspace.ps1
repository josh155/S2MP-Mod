.SYNOPSIS
    Copy every irreplaceable S2MP-Mod work product to a destination on your local PC.

.DESCRIPTION
    Run this from wherever the work happens -- a Hyper-V guest, a second Windows
    install, or the machine itself -- pointing -Destination at a path that lives on
    the PC you want the files to end up on (a mapped share, a second drive, a NAS).

    WHAT IT COPIES, and why each one is irreplaceable:

      repo    the source tree. Git protects the history, but the working branch is
              deliberately not pushed anywhere, so the only copy is on disk.
      IDB     s2x_dump.exe.i64 -- months of function naming. If this is lost, every
              address in CLAUDE.md has to be re-derived. It is the single most
              valuable file in the project.
      demos   main/demo/*.demo and demos/*.dm_s2. A recording cannot be regenerated
              without replaying the same match, and public-match recordings in
              particular took real effort to obtain.
      logs    main/s2mp_console.log -- the measurements the findings rest on.
      config  s2mp_bans.txt and s2mp-mod.cfg.

    ⚠ IDB SAFETY (this is RULE A10 in CLAUDE.md, and it has already cost this project
    two days of naming once). IDA keeps the OPEN database unpacked in loose
    .id0/.id1/.id2/.nam/.til files and only repacks them into the .i64 on a CLEAN
    CLOSE. A hard kill, a crash or a reboot leaves the .i64 STALE. This script checks
    the loose files' timestamps against the .i64 and refuses to present a stale .i64
    as a good backup -- it copies the loose files too, and says so.

.PARAMETER Destination
    Root folder on the local PC to copy into. Created if missing.
    e.g. \\HOSTPC\S2Backup   or   E:\S2-Workspace-Backup

.PARAMETER RepoPath
    The S2MP-Mod checkout. Defaults to two levels above this script.

.PARAMETER GamePath
    The WWII install (for demos and logs).

.PARAMETER IdbPath
    The .i64 database. Defaults to the one inside GamePath.

.PARAMETER WhatIf
    Show what would be copied without copying.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Sync-Workspace.ps1 -Destination E:\S2-Workspace-Backup

/* ===========================================================================
 * centity_s -- Call of Duty: WWII (S2), Steam build s2x_dump.exe
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * Derived 2026-08-17 from S2's OWN code, not ported from a reference build.
 *
 * METHOD
 *   CG_GetEntity (IDA 0x13A00) returns a centity*, so every dereference of its
 *   return value is a field access. All 306 callers were decompiled and every
 *   `*(TYPE *)(var + N)` collected: 116 distinct offsets. The highest touched is
 *   +1804, which fits exactly inside the 1808-byte stride and independently
 *   confirms it.
 *
 *   "hits" below = how many of those 306 functions touch that offset. Advanced
 *   Warfare's centity_s (524 bytes, 32-bit PPC) supplied field NAMES and the
 *   region ordering; its OFFSETS do not transfer and were not used.
 *
 * ONLY PROVEN FIELDS ARE NAMED. Everything else is an explicit _unk_ gap, so an
 * unmapped field shows up in a decompile instead of being silently absorbed.
 * That is deliberate -- it is how +1184 was spotted (see below).
 *
 * REGION MAP
 *   0x000 .. 0x490   pose (cpose_t) + prevState (LerpEntityState).
 *                    OWORD run at 1048/1064/1080/1096/1112/1128/1144, 16-byte
 *                    spaced -- trajectory vectors.
 *   0x490 .. 0x6A0   nextState (entityState_s), ~528 bytes (AW's is 256).
 *                    lerp starts at +1340: eFlags there, then OWORDs at
 *                    1356/1372/1388/1404/1420/1436 = the two trajectories.
 *   0x6A0 .. 0x710   centity scalars (AW places `flags` right after nextState).
 *
 * ACCESSOR
 *   centity_s *CG_GetEntity(int localClientNum, unsigned entnum);   // IDA 0x13A00
 *   returns qword_8B0DB18 + 1808 * ((localClientNum << 11) + entnum)
 *
 *   !! DO NOT CALL IT FROM THE MOD !!
 *   It inspects its own RETURN ADDRESS (Arxan). Called from outside the game
 *   image it does not return what a game-side caller gets -- this is what made
 *   the origin read yield inf/3.9e17 and got `player_box.cpp` wrongly written off
 *   (the OFFSET was always right; the POINTER was not). See CLAUDE.md RULE A22.
 *   And you cannot just reproduce the arithmetic either: qword_8B0DB18 is
 *   ENCRYPTED (reads as 0xF5A16DA2226E8E90 live).
 * =========================================================================== */

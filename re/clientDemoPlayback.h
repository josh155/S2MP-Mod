/* ===========================================================================
 * clientDemoPlayback_t -- Call of Duty: WWII (S2).  Head exact + shift map.
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * This is the struct the demo work has been calling "PlaybackData" and poking
 * with raw offsets for months. Global: qword_10F340A0. Accessor:
 * CL_Demo_GetPlaybackData (IDA 0x915DF0) -- but only 15 functions use it; the
 * other 85 read the global directly, which is why re/map_global_struct.py exists.
 *
 * DERIVATION
 *   103 offsets extracted from all 85 functions referencing the global, then
 *   mapped against AW's fully-named clientDemoPlayback_t (74 members).
 *
 * ⭐ THE HEAD IS EXACT -- offsets AND types
 *   Every field from 0..76 matches AW. Two independent corroborations:
 *     - +28 comes back typed FLOAT from S2's own code, matching AW's timeScale;
 *     - +36..+72 is TEN consecutive dword accesses = AW's buttonPressTime[10],
 *       which lands the head at exactly 76 = AW's persistentDataBuffer offset.
 *
 *   Six of these were already derived by hand in CLAUDE.md and all six were
 *   right: completed@8, overridePause@10, jumpTimeFlag@12, totalBytesRead@24,
 *   timeScale@28, and the byte at +32 that CL_Demo_HandleAction 16/167 toggles --
 *   which AW names hideDemoHud.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ BEYOND THE HEAD THE SHIFT IS A CONSTANT +64000
 *   S2's persistentDataBuffer is 79,356 bytes (the 0x135FC memcpy'd from the demo
 *   header at +0x1C); AW's is 15,356. Difference: exactly 64,000. Everything after
 *   it shifts by that and nothing else changes, confirmed on five independent
 *   offsets -- four of which this project had already measured by hand:
 *
 *     S2 offset    -64000     AW field                     how S2 knew it
 *     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *      2176588     2112588    keyFrame[250] + 4            (extracted here)
 *      3336304     3272304    clipState                    "mode: 3=playing,2=ended"
 *      3336316     3272316    clipRecordBuf[2097152]       "a 2 MB buffer"
 *      5433468     5369468    clipRecordBufIndex           "buffer fill level"
 *      5439380     5375380    inside segments[10]          "stride 65704"  <-- and
 *                                                          657040/10 == 65704 exactly
 *
 *   So to name any S2 offset in this region: subtract 64000 and read AW's field.
 *
 * ⭐ THIS REFRAMES CLAUDE.md's "Finding 7"
 *   That entry records "a 2 MB in-memory demo buffer with a second reader" at
 *   +3336316, fill level at +5433468, and treats it as a general demo read buffer.
 *   It is AW's **clipRecordBuf** / **clipRecordBufIndex** -- the CLIP RECORDING
 *   buffer. So the "second reader" (sub_919190) is the clip preview/playback path,
 *   not an alternate route for normal demo reading. The measurement was right; the
 *   interpretation was broader than the truth.
 *
 *   Likewise +3336304, recorded as "mode: 3 = playing, 2 = ended, 1 = clip
 *   capture", is **clipState** -- so those values are clip states, which is exactly
 *   consistent with "1 = clip capture" but explains why the numbering looked odd.
 *
 * ⚠ NOT ESTABLISHED: total size. The +64000 shift does NOT hold all the way down --
 *   CLAUDE.md's camera mode at +6297228 and block count at +6096400 do not land on
 *   AW fields at that shift, so there are further insertions deeper in. Do not
 *   extrapolate past the table above without checking.
